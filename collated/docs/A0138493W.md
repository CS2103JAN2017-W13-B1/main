uTask is a task manager for advanced users to manage their daily tasks through keyboard commands. It is
a java desktop application has a GUI implemented with JavaFX.

This Developer Guide provides general information about setting up and design for uTask. It focuses
primarily on setting up, design, implementation, testing and DevOps. It will help developers to understand
how uTask works and how to further improve it. The guide is in top-down manner, so you can look at the
overall picture of uTask and then breaking down the various components in each sub-section. Each sub-section
is self-contained, you can easily set up and start contributing by following the guide.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/utask/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")`
 API call.<br>

**`Logic` Interface**

The `Logic` interface contains two abstract methods which allows you to do any logic-related operation, such as executing commands. This interface can be accessed by any class in any package.

**Notable APIs**

Return type | Method and Description
----------- | ----------------------
CommandResult() | `execute(String commandText)`: Executes the command `commandText` and returns the result.
ObservableList() | `getFilteredTaskList()`: Retrieves the filtered task list from the **`Model`** component.

### Model component

Author: LIU JIAHAO

_Figure 2.4.1 : Structure of the Model Component_

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/utask/model/Model.java)

The `Model`:

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the UTask data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

**`Model` Interface:**

The **`Model`** interface allows you to access all the model-related operations, such as retrieving or modifying utask and user preference. This is using mediator pattern, other component outside `Model` will have to talk to **`Model`** interface. Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator.

**`ModelManager` Class:**
The `ModelManager` class implements the **`Model`** interface, and provides all the services and functionality specifed in the **`Model`** interface.

Other components should not directly use this class, you may access the method through **`Model`** interface.

**`ReadOnlyTask` Interface:**
The **`ReadOnlyTask`** allow you to retrieve tasks, but not edit tasks. You can get full task list and tag list using this interface. This is using Decorator pattern, whichever implements the **`ReadOnlyTask`** interface will implement the methods.

**`UTask` Class:**
The **`UTask`** class implements the **`ReadOnlyTask`** interface, and responsible for managing the task list. You should not directly call any methods in this class, you can access them via the `ModelManager` class.

**`UserPrefs` Class:**

The `UserPrefs` class is responsible for storing application settings.

**`AliasCommandMap` Class:**

The `AliasCommandMap` class is used to store a HashMap of alias maps command.
